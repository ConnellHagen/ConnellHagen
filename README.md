# Connell Hagen

Hello everyone! My name is Connell and I'm an 18 year old Computer Science major at the University of Minnesota.

I have been taking computer science classes since I was a junior in high school (2020 - 2021), and am currently looking for an opportunity to start some work in the industry to get some real world experience. My hope would be to get an internship this summmer, which would be a great learning experience for me, however I am also interested in learning about working a co-op. 

My public repositories are some of the projects that I've worked on (mostly in high school) that I think were a good learning experience for me, and I'm currently working on making projects now that are more utile and practical.

Here are a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python Discord bot that allows users in the same Discord server to play Connect 4 with each other.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning functional programming with OCaml, and C through my current university classes.
- ðŸ˜€ My current favorite language overall to use is C++.
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him.
- ðŸ“« My email is hagen.connell@gmail.com if you have any inquiries you would like to reach me about.
